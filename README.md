# Volkswagen-Blinker-PCB
A PCB depicting the 'Volkswagen' logo featuring 10 blue LEDs inside the 'V' and 'W'. Dimensions 108.48mm x 108.48mm.
I made this through a Hackclub workshop at the University of Waterloo.
It uses a 555 sequencer to time the LEDs. The event was very interesting and learned alot!
I would suggest anyone who has the chance to go to one of their workshops.
